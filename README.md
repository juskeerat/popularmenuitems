## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Google Places API key (optional but recommended)

### Setup

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

3. **Set up Google Places API (Recommended)**
   
   For the best experience and most reliable data, set up a Google Places API key:

   b. Create a new project or select an existing one
   c. Enable the "Places API"
   d. Create credentials (API key)
   e. Copy the API key
   
   f. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   
   g. Add your API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_google_places_api_key_here
   ```
   
   **Free Tier:** Google Places API offers a $200 monthly credit until February 28, 2025!

4. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Development Mode

## Technical Details

### Backend Technologies
- **Express.js**: Web server framework
- **Google Places API**: Primary data source for restaurant information and reviews
- **Puppeteer**: Headless browser for web scraping (fallback method)
- **Natural**: Natural language processing library
- **Cheerio**: HTML parsing and manipulation
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API requests

### Frontend Technologies
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients and animations
- **Font Awesome**: Icons and visual elements

### Key Components

#### Data Retrieval (`server.js`)
- **Primary**: Uses Google Places API for reliable restaurant data
- **Fallback**: Web scraping with Puppeteer when API is unavailable
- Extracts review text, ratings, and restaurant details
- Handles both regular and shortened Google Maps URLs

#### Dish Analysis (`server.js`)
- Comprehensive food keyword database
- Sentiment analysis using AFINN lexicon
- Scoring algorithm for dish ranking

#### User Interface (`public/index.html`)
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Real-time loading states
- Error handling and user feedback

## Food Keywords Database

The app includes an extensive database of food-related keywords covering:
- International cuisines (Italian, Asian, Mexican, Indian, etc.)
- Common dishes (pizza, sushi, tacos, curry, etc.)
- Desserts and beverages
- Ingredients and cooking methods

## Limitations

- **Google Maps Structure**: The app relies on Google Maps' current HTML structure and may need updates if Google changes their layout
- **Rate Limiting**: Google may limit requests if too many are made in a short time
- **Review Availability**: Only analyzes reviews that are publicly visible on Google Maps
- **Language**: Currently optimized for English-language reviews

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No reviews found"**
   - Ensure the URL is from Google Maps
   - Check if the restaurant has public reviews
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **"Failed to analyze restaurant"**
   - Check your internet connection
   - The restaurant page might be temporarily unavailable
   - Try again in a few minutes

3. **Slow loading**
   - The app needs to scrape multiple reviews
   - Larger restaurants with more reviews take longer
   - Be patient during the analysis process

### Performance Tips

- The app limits analysis to 50 reviews for performance
- Only dishes mentioned at least twice are included
- Results are cached during the session
